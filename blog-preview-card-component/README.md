# Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01I_).

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to practice my foundational HTML and CSS skills. Some key things I focused on were:

- **Semantic HTML:** Using tags like `<main>`, `<time>`, and `<h2>` to give the content proper structure and meaning.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Using CSS variables (`:root`) to manage colors. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Flexbox:** I used Flexbox to easily align the author's avatar and name side-by-side. The `gap` property was very useful for creating space between them.
- **Responsive Units:** Using `rem` for padding, margins, and font sizes to create a more scalable and accessible design.
