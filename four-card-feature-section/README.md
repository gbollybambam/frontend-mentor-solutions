## 🚀 Overview

This project is a perfect exercise in building a responsive layout that adapts from a single mobile column to a complex desktop grid. I built this using a mobile-first workflow, focusing on semantic HTML and styling with Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 What I learned

This project was a fantastic way to practice responsive design using Tailwind's utility-first approach.

* I learned how to use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (like `lg:`) to apply styles only at specific breakpoints.
* I successfully implemented a **mobile-first** design, starting with a simple `flex flex-col` for mobile devices.
* For the desktop layout, I switched to a `lg:grid` with `lg:grid-cols-3` to create the more complex 3-column structure.
* I learned how to stack the two middle cards by wrapping them in a `div`, which then became a single item in the parent grid.
* I also used `lg:items-center` on the grid container to vertically center the side cards ("Supervisor" and "Calculator") for a clean, aligned look.
